this is not part of the oxford deep learnign course directly. Within the first practical, you are suppose to learn how to use lua and torch. On the website for learning that, I ran into a tutorial for setting up a multilayered convolutional network with maxpooling and a non-linearity component, along with a fully connected network at the end. This network classifies images from the CIFAR test set, which contains 10 differet types of images, such as trucks, airplanes, and dogs. Here is the tutorial I used: https://github.com/soumith/cvpr2015/blob/master/Deep%20Learning%20with%20Torch.ipynb
