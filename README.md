# OxfordDeepLearning

Some files from this repo are completed assignments from the following Oxford class on Deep Learning: https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/machinelearning/

Some of these files are also machine learning algorithms I implemented while takign the course, and may have been inspired by some of the practicals. 
Some of these files I may have changed parts to accomplish my own goals.
